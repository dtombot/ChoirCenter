          At Choir Center, you’ll discover a growing collection of resources tailored for the choral community. From music scripts in both staff and solfa notation to publicly available audio recordings, we’re building a treasure trove for singers and directors. But we’re not stopping there—our vision is bold. We aim to become the ultimate online source for choir resources, offering studio recording and production services, a dedicated choral auditorium for live performances, and a music academy to train the next generation of talent. Imagine accommodations for conventions and visiting choristers, creating a space where music lovers unite!
